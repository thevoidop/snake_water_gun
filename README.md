# Snake-Water-Gun

This Python script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player chooses between Snake, Water, and Gun to compete against the computer's random selection. The game follows the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

## How to Play

  1. Run the script:
  
  ```bash
  python rock_paper_scissors.py
  ```
  2. Enter your choice when prompted: "Snake(s), Water(w), or Gun(g)."
  3. The computer will randomly choose one of the options.
  4. The game results will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or the game ended in a draw.

## Code Overview
  The code consists of a game function that takes the player's choice (resp) and the computer's random choice (rand). It then determines the game result based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
  The user is prompted to input their choice (Snake, Water, or Gun), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The game result is then displayed.

## Example Output
  ```scss
  Choose - Snake(s), Water(w), or Gun(g):  s
  Computer is choosing
  
  You chose Snake
  Computer chose Water
  
  Congratulations! You won
  ```
